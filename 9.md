A. Program creation 
B. Hardware design and manufacturing 
C. Access to I/O devices

D. To provide a boundary between hardware and software. 

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The document states that the Application Binary Interface (ABI) "Defines a standard for binary portability across programs".

Question 3: An Operating System functions as a control mechanism. In which unusual respect does it behave compared to ordinary computer software?
A. It is entirely hardware-based and does not execute as a program. 
B. It always retains continuous control of the processor. 
C. It frequently relinquishes control and depends on the processor to regain control. 
D. It only manages memory resources, not processing or I/O. 


Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The document highlights that the OS as a control mechanism is unusual because "The OS frequently relinquishes control and must depend on the processor to allow it to regain control".

C. Frequent system crashes due to OS conflicts.
D. Automatic configuration of peripherals.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: For "Early Systems," the document explains that "A single program could involve Loading the compiler plus the source program into memory Saving the compiled program Loading and linking together the object program and common functions" as part of the "Setup time" problem.

Question 5: What is the primary function of a "Timer" as a desirable hardware feature for an Operating System?

B. To prevent a user job from monopolizing the system by triggering an interrupt if it expires. 
C. To synchronize data transfer between the CPU and I/O devices.
D. To provide real-time clock functionality for applications.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The document states that a "Timer" is "Used to prevent a job from monopolizing the system" and that "If the timer expires an interrupt occurs and control returns to monitor".

A. It decreases from 40% to 20%. 
B. It increases from 20% to 40%. 
C. It remains constant at 33%. 
D. It increases from 33% to 67%. 

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: According to "Table 9.2: Effects of Multiprogramming on Resource Utilization," Processor use (%) changes from 20% in Uniprogramming to 40% in Multiprogramming.

Question 7: What is the principal objective of a "Time Sharing" system, as compared to "Batch Multiprogramming"?
A. Maximize processor use. 
B. Minimize response time. 
C. Process jobs sequentially. 
D. Reduce memory consumption. 

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: "Table 9.3: Batch Multiprogramming versus Time Sharing" indicates that the "Principal objective" for "Time Sharing" is to "Minimize response time," whereas for "Batch Multiprogramming" it is to "Maximize processor use".

Question 8: Which type of scheduling is responsible for the decision to add processes that are partially or fully in main memory?
A. Long-term scheduling 
B. Medium-term scheduling 
C. Short-term scheduling 
D. I/O scheduling 


Correct Answer: B
Explanation: "Table 9.4: Types of Scheduling" defines "Medium-term scheduling" as "The decision to add to the number of processes that are partially or fully in main memory".

Question 9: In the Five-State Process Model (Figure 9.7), what transition occurs when a process in the "Ready" state is chosen to be executed by the processor?
A. Admit 
B. Timeout 
C. Dispatch 
D. Event Wait 

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Figure 9.7, "Five-State Process Model," shows that the transition from "Ready" to "Running" is labeled "Dispatch".

Question 10: Which of the following is typically NOT found in a Process Control Block (PCB)?
A. Program counter 
B. Priority 
C. Manufacturer's serial number 
D. Memory pointers 

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Figure 9.8, "Process Control Block," lists "Identifier," "State," "Priority," "Program counter," "Memory pointers," "Context data," "I/O status information," and "Accounting information" as elements of a PCB. A manufacturer's serial number is not listed.

Question 11: What is the distinction between a "Logical address" and a "Physical address" in memory management?
A. A logical address is an actual location in main memory, while a physical address is relative to the program. 
B. A logical address is expressed as a location relative to the beginning of the program, while a physical address is an actual location in main memory. 
C. Both refer to the same actual location in main memory. 
D. A logical address is used for I/O devices, and a physical address is for CPU access. 

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The document defines "Logical address" as "expressed as a location relative to the beginning of the program" and "Physical address" as "an actual location in main memory".

Question 12: Which memory management technique brings each page of a process into main memory only when it is needed, leveraging the principle of locality?
A. Swapping 
B. Fixed Partitioning 
C. Demand Paging (Virtual Memory) 
D. Dynamic Partitioning 



Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The section on "Demand Paging Virtual Memory" explicitly states that "Each page of a process is brought in only when it is needed" and that it benefits from the "Principle of locality".

Question 13: What is "Thrashing" in the context of Demand Paging?
A. When the processor spends most of its time executing instructions. 
B. When the processor spends most of its time swapping pages rather than executing instructions. 
C. A high cache hit rate.
D. The process of initially loading all pages of a program into memory.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: The document defines "Thrashing" as a disadvantage of Demand Paging, occurring "When the processor spends most of its time swapping pages rather than executing instructions".

Question 14: In the operation of Paging and Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) (Figure 9.18), what happens if the CPU generates a virtual address and the page table entry is NOT in the TLB (TLB miss)?
A. The CPU immediately generates a physical address. 
B. The OS instructs the CPU to read the page from disk. 
C. The system accesses the Page Table. 
D. A page fault handling routine is immediately returned. 

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Figure 9.18, "Operation of Paging and Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)," shows that if a "Page table entry in TLB?" is "No," the next step is to "Access Page Table".
