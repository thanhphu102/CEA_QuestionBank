# Review Questions: The Memory Hierarchy

## Principle of Locality

1.  Question 1: The Principle of Locality, also known as locality of reference, reflects which observation during program execution?
    A. Memory references by the processor are uniformly distributed.
    B. Memory references by the processor tend to cluster.
    C. Memory references are unpredictable over time.
    D. Memory references are independent of past access patterns.
    Correct answer is: B. Memory references by the processor tend to cluster.
    Because: The Principle of Locality states that during the execution of a program, memory references by the processor tend to cluster, meaning certain memory locations are referenced repeatedly within a short period.

2.  Question 2: Which of the following is NOT one of the three assertions on which the Principle of Locality is based?
    A. During any interval of time, a program references memory locations non-uniformly.
    B. As a function of time, the probability that a given unit of memory is referenced tends to change slowly.
    C. The correlation between immediate past and immediate future memory reference patterns is low.
    D. The correlation between immediate past and immediate future memory reference patterns is high and tapers off as the time interval increases.
    Correct answer is: C. The correlation between immediate past and immediate future memory reference patterns is low.
    Because: One of the assertions of the Principle of Locality is that the correlation between immediate past and immediate future memory reference patterns is high and tapers off as the time interval increases, not low.

3.  Question 3: What are the two forms of locality mentioned in the context of memory hierarchy?
    A. Read locality and Write locality
    B. CPU locality and I/O locality
    C. Temporal locality and Spatial locality
    D. Cache locality and Main memory locality
    Correct answer is: C. Temporal locality and Spatial locality.
    Because: The two forms of locality are temporal locality and spatial locality.

4.  Question 4: Temporal locality refers to which tendency of a program?
    A. To reference units of memory whose addresses are near one another in the near future.
    B. To reference in the near future those units of memory referenced in the recent past.
    C. To access data locations sequentially, such as when processing a table of data.
    D. To reference memory locations randomly without any pattern.
    Correct answer is: B. To reference in the near future those units of memory referenced in the recent past.
    Because: Temporal locality refers to the tendency of a program to reference in the near future those units of memory referenced in the recent past.

5.  Question 5: What constructs can lead to the principle of temporal locality?
    A. Large arrays and linked lists.
    B. Constants, temporary variables, and working stacks.
    C. Network protocols and device drivers.
    D. Graphics processing units and sound cards.
    Correct answer is: B. Constants, temporary variables, and working stacks.
    Because: Constants, temporary variables, and working stacks are constructs that lead to the principle of temporal locality.

6.  Question 6: Spatial locality reflects which tendency of a program?
    A. To reference the same memory location repeatedly over time.
    B. To reference units of memory whose addresses are near one another.
    C. To access memory locations in an unpredictable order.
    D. To reference memory only from external storage devices.
    Correct answer is: B. To reference units of memory whose addresses are near one another.
    Because: Spatial locality refers to the tendency of a program to reference units of memory whose addresses are near one another. It also reflects the tendency to access data locations sequentially.

    B. Direct access
    C. Associative access
    D. Sequential access
    Correct answer is: D. Sequential access.
    Because: In sequential access, memory is organized into units of data called records, and access must be made in a specific linear sequence.

11. Question 11: In which access method does each addressable location in memory have a unique, physically wired-in addressing mechanism, and the time to access a given location is independent of prior accesses?
    A. Sequential access
    B. Direct access
    C. Random access
    D. Associative access
    Correct answer is: C. Random access.

    A. Sequential access
    B. Direct access
    C. Random access
    D. Associative access
    Correct answer is: B. Direct access.
    Because: Direct access involves a shared read-write mechanism where individual blocks or records have a unique address based on physical location, and access time is variable.

    A. Sequential access
    B. Direct access
    C. Random access
    D. Associative access
    Correct answer is: D. Associative access.
    Because: Associative access retrieves a word based on a portion of its contents, not its address, and each location has its own addressing mechanism, leading to constant retrieval time. Cache memories may employ this method.

    C. The time it takes to position the read-write mechanism at the desired location.
    D. The time for a read or write operation plus any additional time required before a second access can commence.
    Correct answer is: D. The time for a read or write operation plus any additional time required before a second access can commence.
    Because: Memory cycle time is defined as access time plus any additional time required before a second access can commence, which may include time for transients to die out or to regenerate data.

    A. Access time.
    B. Memory cycle time.
    C. 1 / (cycle time).

    A. Locality.
    B. Inclusion.
    C. Coherence.
    D. Hierarchy.
    Correct answer is: C. Coherence.

32. Question 32: In the operation of a two-level memory, what happens if an attempt to access an item in the upper-level memory (M1) fails?
    A. The system reports an error.
    B. The item is directly accessed from M2 without copying.
    C. A block of memory locations is copied from M2 to M1, and the access then takes place via M1.
    D. The processor waits until M1 is available.
    Correct answer is: C. A block of memory locations is copied from M2 to M1, and the access then takes place via M1.
    Because: If an access attempt in M1 fails, a block of memory locations is copied from M2 to M1, and the access then occurs via M1.
