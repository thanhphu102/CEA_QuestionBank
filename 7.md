Question 1: Which material is traditionally used as the substrate for magnetic disks?
A. Glass
B. Polycarbonate
C. Aluminum or aluminum alloy
D. Magnetizable material
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Traditionally, the substrate for magnetic disks has been an aluminum or aluminum alloy material. Glass substrates have been introduced more recently for their benefits but are not the traditional material. Polycarbonate is associated with optical disks, and the magnetizable material is a coating, not the substrate itself.

Question 2: What is one of the benefits of introducing glass substrates in magnetic disks?
A. Reduced data density
B. Increased read-write errors
C. Greater ability to withstand shock and damage
D. Higher power consumption
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Glass substrates offer better stiffness and a greater ability to withstand shock and damage, along with improvements in uniformity, reduced surface defects, and support for lower fly heights, all contributing to increased reliability and potentially higher data density. They do not lead to reduced data density, increased errors, or higher power consumption.

Question 3: In a movable-head disk system, what does 'seek time' refer to?
A. The time it takes for the beginning of the sector to reach the head.
B. The time it takes to position the head at the desired track.
C. The time taken for the read or write operation as the sector moves under the head.
D. The sum of seek time, latency time, and transfer time.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Seek time is specifically defined as the time required to position the read-write head at the desired track in a movable-head disk system. Option A describes rotational delay (latency), Option C describes transfer time, and Option D describes the total block access time.

Question 4: A Toshiba L200 hard disk drive has a spindle speed of 7200 rpm. What is its average latency?
A. 2.9 ms
B. 4.16 ms
C. 5.6 ms
D. 8.0 ms
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Based on the provided typical hard disk drive parameters, the Toshiba L200 has an average latency of 4.16 ms. 2.9 ms is its average read seek time, and 5.6 ms and 8.0 ms are related to other drives or parameters.

Question 5: Which RAID level distributes data across physical drives using striping but without redundancy, making it prone to data loss if a single drive fails?
A. RAID Level 1
B. RAID Level 5
C. RAID Level 0
D. RAID Level 6
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: RAID Level 0 employs nonredundant striping, which enhances performance by distributing data across multiple disks. However, it offers no fault tolerance; if any disk in the array fails, all data is lost. RAID Level 1 uses mirroring, and RAID Levels 5 and 6 use parity for redundancy.

Question 6: What is a primary disadvantage of Solid State Drives (SSDs) compared to Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)?
A. Higher access times and latency rates
B. Quieter operation
C. Tendency for performance to slow down as the device is used
D. Lower power consumption
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: While SSDs offer advantages like lower access times, quieter operation, and lower power consumption, a significant practical issue is that their performance can degrade over time, especially with repeated write and erase operations, due to the nature of flash memory.

Question 7: A CD-ROM has a capacity of approximately 650 Mbytes. How does a single-sided, dual-layer DVD-ROM's capacity compare to this?
A. It is approximately the same capacity.
B. It is slightly less than a CD-ROM.
C. It can hold up to 17 GB, significantly more than a CD-ROM.
D. It is limited to audio information only.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: A single-sided, dual-layer DVD-ROM can hold 8.5 GB, and a double-sided, dual-layer DVD-ROM can hold up to 17 GB. Both capacities are significantly higher than the 650 Mbytes of a standard CD-ROM. DVDs are not limited to audio information.

Question 8: Which optical disk type allows the user to write to the disk only once?
A. CD-RW
B. DVD-RW
C. Blu-ray DVD
D. CD-R
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable) is a write-once, read-many (WORM) medium, meaning data can be written to it only once, but read many times. CD-RW and DVD-RW are re-writable formats, and while Blu-ray has recordable versions, CD-R is the specific type described by "write only once" among the options.

Question 9: What is a key characteristic of RAID Level 1 (Mirrored)?
A. Data is distributed across physical drives in a nonredundant manner.
B. Redundancy is achieved through Hamming code.
C. Each logical strip is mapped to two separate physical disks for duplication.
D. It requires only a single redundant disk regardless of array size.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: RAID Level 1, or mirroring, achieves redundancy by maintaining an exact duplicate of data. Each logical strip (or block) of data is written to two separate physical disks simultaneously, ensuring that if one disk fails, the data is still available on the mirrored disk.

Question 10: In magnetic tape systems, what are the contiguous blocks of data that are read and written called?
A. Inter-record gaps
B. Tracks
C. Physical records
D. Serial recordings
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: On magnetic tape, data is organized and accessed in contiguous blocks known as physical records. Inter-record gaps are empty spaces between these blocks, tracks are the paths on the tape, and serial recording describes the bit-by-bit storage along a track.

Question 11: An HGST Ultrastar C15K600 drive has a spindle speed of 15,030 rpm. What is its maximum sustained transfer rate?
A. 255 MB/s
B. 1.2 GB/s
C. 3 GB/s
D. 788 MB/s
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: According to the provided specifications, the HGST Ultrastar C15K600 drive has a maximum sustained transfer rate of 1.2 GB/s. The other options correspond to different drives or media types.

Question 12: What distinguishes a fixed-head disk from a movable-head disk?
A. A fixed-head disk has a single read-write head for all tracks, while a movable-head disk has one per surface.
B. Fixed-head disks are permanently mounted, while movable-head disks are removable.
C. A fixed-head disk has one read-write head per track, while a movable-head disk has one read-write head that moves across tracks.
D. Fixed-head disks use aerodynamic gaps, while movable-head disks use contact mechanisms.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The primary distinction is in the head mechanism. A fixed-head disk has a dedicated read-write head for each track, providing very fast access. In contrast, a movable-head disk uses a single read-write head (or one per surface) that moves radially across the platters to access different tracks.

Question 13: What is the typical range for the number of platters in a hard disk drive?
A. 1 to 2
B. 3 to 5
C. 6 to 10
D. 12 to 15
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: A typical hard disk drive usually contains multiple platters, ranging from 3 to 5. Each platter requires its own read-write head for each surface, except for the top and bottom surfaces if not used.

Question 14: How is data typically recorded on a magnetic disk platter?
A. As continuous analog signals.
B. As discrete magnetic spots on concentric tracks.
C. As optical patterns burned onto the surface.
D. As pits and lands organized spirally.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Data is recorded on magnetic disks by magnetizing discrete spots on the surface. These spots are arranged along concentric circles called tracks. The read/write head detects changes in magnetic polarization, representing binary data.

Question 15: What is the purpose of an inter-record gap (IRG) in magnetic tape?
A. To store metadata about the tape content.
B. To provide space for the tape drive to accelerate and decelerate between blocks.
C. To prevent data corruption during read/write operations.
D. To mark the end of a tape volume.
Correct Answer: B
Explanation: An inter-record gap (IRG) is a blank space deliberately left between physical records (blocks of data) on a magnetic tape. This gap allows the tape drive enough time to accelerate to the required speed for reading/writing or to decelerate to a stop between operations without losing data.

Question 16: Which of the following is NOT a typical component of a hard disk drive?
A. Platters
B. Read/write heads
C. Spindle motor
D. Laser diode
Correct Answer: D
Explanation: Hard disk drives (HDDs) use magnetic technology, which involves platters, read/write heads, and a spindle motor to rotate the platters. A laser diode is a component typically found in optical disc drives (like CD, DVD, Blu-ray drives) for reading and writing data using light.

Question 17: In the context of disk performance, what is the significance of the transfer rate?
A. It indicates how quickly the head can move to a specific track.
B. It measures the time taken to rotate the disk to the desired sector.
C. It represents the rate at which data can be read from or written to the disk surface.
D. It is the total time required to access a block of data.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Transfer rate refers to the rate at which data bits can be transferred between the disk and the computer system once the head is positioned over the desired sector. It quantifies how fast data flows during the actual read or write operation.

Question 18: What is the main advantage of RAID Level 5 over RAID Level 4?
A. RAID 5 provides higher data security.
B. RAID 5 uses mirroring, which is faster.
C. RAID 5 distributes parity across all disks, avoiding a bottleneck.
D. RAID 5 requires fewer disks than RAID 4.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Both RAID 4 and RAID 5 use block-level striping with a dedicated parity. However, RAID 4 keeps all parity information on a single, dedicated parity disk, which can become a bottleneck during write operations. RAID 5 distributes the parity information across all the data disks, which resolves this bottleneck issue and improves write performance.

Question 19: Why are SSDs generally preferred over HDDs in portable devices like laptops for durability?
A. SSDs have a larger storage capacity.
B. SSDs consume more power.
C. SSDs have no moving parts, making them more resistant to shock and vibration.
D. SSDs are significantly cheaper than HDDs.
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The primary reason SSDs are more durable for portable devices is their lack of moving mechanical parts. This makes them highly resistant to physical shock and vibration, unlike HDDs with their spinning platters and read/write heads, which are vulnerable to damage from drops or impacts.

Question 20: What type of information is typically stored on a Blu-ray disc, emphasizing its high capacity?
A. Standard definition audio files
B. Low-resolution images
C. High-definition video (e.g., movies)
D. Basic text documents
Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Blu-ray discs were specifically developed to store and play back high-definition video and high-density data. Their significantly larger storage capacity (up to 25 GB for single-layer, 50 GB for dual-layer) makes them ideal for full-length high-definition movies and large data archives, which would not fit on standard DVDs or CDs.
