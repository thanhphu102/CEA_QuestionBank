Question 8: A 16-Mbit DRAM chip is organized as 4M x 4. What does the "4M" represent in this organization?
A. The number of data output lines.
B. The number of memory cells in each array.
C. The number of words (or unique addresses) in the memory array. 
D. The number of memory banks.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: A 16-Mbit DRAM (4M x 4) means it has 4 million words, each 4 bits wide. Figure 6.3 shows "Memory array (2048 x 2048 x 4)". This indicates the overall capacity and organization, with 4M referring to the number of addressable locations (words).

Question 9: For a memory module with 256 KBytes of storage, using chips organized as 512 words by 512 bits, how many such chips are required?
A. 1
B. 2
C. 4
D. 8 

Correct Answer: D
Explanation: A 256 KByte memory is 256×1024×8 bits = 2048×1024 bits.
Each chip is 512 words by 512 bits. Assuming a "word" here means a data unit that aligns with byte addressing, which is standard, and looking at Figure 6.5, "256-KByte Memory Organization", it shows 8 chips, each "512 words by 512 bits" contributing to an overall 8-bit output.
Calculation:
Total bits required = 256 KB = 256×1024×8 bits = 2,097,152 bits.
Capacity of one chip = 512 words * 512 bits/word = 262,144 bits.
Number of chips = Total bits required / Capacity per chip = 2,097,152 bits / 262,144 bits/chip = 8 chips. 

Question 10: What is the primary benefit of using "Interleaved Memory" in a computer system?
A. It simplifies memory chip fabrication.
B. It reduces the power consumption of memory modules.
C. It allows for simultaneous service of multiple memory requests, speeding up block transfers. 
D. It improves the reliability of memory by providing redundancy.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The document states that in interleaved memory, "Each bank is independently able to service a memory read or write request" and "K banks can service K requests simultaneously, increasing memory read or write rates by a factor of K". It also mentions, "If consecutive words of memory are stored in different banks, the transfer of a block of memory is speeded up".

Question 11: Which type of memory error is described as a "Permanent physical defect" where memory cells cannot reliably store data?

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The document defines "Hard Failure" as a "Permanent physical defect" where "Memory cell or cells affected cannot reliably store data but become stuck at 0 or 1 or switch erratically between 0 and 1".

Question 12: A "Soft Error" in memory is typically caused by what kind of event?
A. Manufacturing defects in the memory chip. 
B. Wear and tear on the memory cells over time. 
C. Random, non-destructive events like power supply problems or alpha particles. 
D. Physical damage to the memory module.

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: The document defines a "Soft Error" as a "Random, non-destructive event that alters the contents of one or more memory cells"  and lists "Power supply problems" and "Alpha particles" as causes.

D. Using higher clock rate on the bus to increase the transfer rate. 

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: DDR achieves higher data rates by synchronizing to both rising and falling edges, using a higher clock rate on the bus, and employing a buffering scheme. Using a lower clock rate is contrary to its design for higher data rates.

D. It is a volatile memory type.

Correct Answer: B
Explanation: Flash memory is described as "intermediate between EPROM and EEPROM in both cost and functionality". It "does not provide byte-level erasure" , and "Uses only one transistor per bit so it achieves the high density of EPROM". It is also nonvolatile.

Question 20: Which of the following nonvolatile RAM technologies uses a thin insulating layer between a free layer and a reference layer, with data stored based on the direction of magnetization?
A. PCRAM (Phase Change RAM) 
B. ReRAM (Resistive RAM)

Correct Answer: C
Explanation: Figure 6.21(a) "STT-RAM"  shows a structure with a "Free layer," "Reference layer," and "Insulating layer". The "Direction of magnetization" is shown to change between binary 0 and binary 1, which corresponds to the description of STT-RAM.
